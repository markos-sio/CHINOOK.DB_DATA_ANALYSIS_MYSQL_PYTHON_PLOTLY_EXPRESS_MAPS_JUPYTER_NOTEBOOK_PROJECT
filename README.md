This project leverages MySQL and Python to extract insights from the Chinook database. The entire analysis is presented using Jupyter Notebook. The primary focus is on addressing critical questions such as "Which 10 music genres have the highest sales?" and "What is the geospatial distribution of sales?" To provide clear and comprehensive answers, various visualization tools, including maps, bar plots, and donut charts, have been created using the powerful Plotly Express and Plotly Graph Objects libraries.
